# Fake Resume

## Overview
Grumpy cat is looking for a new job! Using what you know about HTML and CSS, help him by creating a resume website for him. (Note: You don't need to know 'real information' about Grumpy Cat -- just make things up!)

## Getting Started
- `Fork` and `clone` this repository
- `cd` into the directory on your local machine
- Create an `index.html` and `main.css` file and make sure they are linked together
- Once these files are created and linked, run `open index.html` to open the website in your browser and `cmd + option + i` (MacOS) or `ctrl + shift + i` (Windows/Linux) to open your dev tools

This is what he wants you to include and do for his resume:

- have an `index.html` file
- have an `main.css` file that is linked to the `index.html` file
- have HTML `boilerplate` code for `index.html`
  - _HINT:_ in your `index.html` file type `html` or `!` and press tab. A few basic HTML tags should populate your file, including `head` and `body`
- Include:
  - at least one header
  - navigation (these can be dummy links that don't go anywhere yet)
  - at least one list
  - change the font color in at least one place
  - change the background in at least one place
  - change the font in at least one place

## Adding Content
1. Insert a professional image of Grumpy Cat (`<img>` tag), it should be placed right after your `<h1>` tags
1. Insert an unordered list of his past three work positions (`<ul>` tag)
1. Create links for LinkedIn and Facebook/Twitter pages (`<a>` tag). You can set this to a dummy link
1. Use level-three heading tags to create headings before the work positions and before the links

:red_circle: **Commit your work!** <br>
Your commit message should read something like: <br>
"added initial content for resume site"

Add some style to your site and feel free to style it however you want! Here are some ideas:

1. Center your `<h1>` tag
1. Change the font of your `<h1>` tag
1. Change the color of the font of your `<h3>` tag
1. Add some space on the body of your application to make your site look more appealing.

:red_circle: **Commit your work!** <br>
Your commit message should read something like: <br>
"added styling for resume site"

## Adding Navigation
1. Create a nav bar with the links to LinkedIn, Twitter (whichever links you had created earlier); Remove the links section that you had created earlier in the homework
1. In the nav bar, also create a link to the 'index.html' page (maybe give it a name of `Home Page` in the bar), and a link to a file called "projects.html" (maybe call this `Projects` in the bar)
1. Create another html file in this folder called 'projects.html'
1. Copy the contents of the nav bar and information from the 'head' tag of your `index.html` file and paste it into your `projects.html` file
1. Inside `projects.html`, create a level-two heading and add the text `Projects`
1. Check to make sure that your links work! When you click on "Projects" in your nav bar, does it open the `projects.html` document?
1. In `projects.html`, add three projects that Grumpy Cat has worked on. To do this simply, you can use an ordered list. If you're up for a little more of a challenge, create three columns: each column should contain the title and a description of their three most recent, successful projects

:red_circle: **Commit your work!** <br>
Your commit message should read something like: <br>
"added project.html page and content - finished resume"

1. Add a level-three heading above his contact info with a title for the section

1. Give the body of the page a thicker border than the picture but only on the top and bottom of the page
1. Using HTML, insert a short blurb or biography with `<p>` tags
1. Using HTML, insert a short description above your `<p>` tag; use an `<h3>` tag
1. Make his name uppercase <strong>using CSS</strong>
